# zkSync Era JavaScript Examples

Examples are made to demonstrate how [zksync-ethers](https://github.com/zksync-sdk/zksync-ethers)
SDK can be used for development. The examples demonstrate how to:

1. Deposit ETH from Ethereum to zkSync Era.
2. Transfer ETH on zkSync Era.
3. Withdraw ETH from zkSync Era to Ethereum.
4. Deploy a smart contract using create opcode.
5. Deploy a smart contract with constructor using create opcode.
6. Deploy a smart contract with dependency using create opcode.
7. Deploy a smart contract using create2 opcode.
8. Deploy a smart contract with constructor using create2 opcode.
9. Deploy a smart contract with dependency using create2 opcode.
10. Deposit token from Ethereum into zkSync Era.
11. Transfer token on zkSync Era.
12. Withdraw token from zkSync Era to Ethereum.
13. Deploy custom token on zkSync Era.
14. Deploy smart account using create opcode.
15. Deploy smart account using create2 opcode.
16. Use paymaster to pay fee with token.

Smart contract deployment use already generated bytecodes and ABIs and go bindings.
There is a [user guide](../solidity/README.md) on how those artifacts
are generated. Same approach can be used to generate required artifact
for other smart contracts.

## Setup

```shell
yarn install
```
